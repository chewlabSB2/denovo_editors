*Computational workflow for denovo editors*
![Picture1](https://github.com/chewlabSB2/denovo_editors/assets/87451986/d1ae18b8-23a2-45fe-bbe5-89fa0f2fb197)

1. Clone the denovo_editors repository 
```bash
cd scratch
git clone https://github.com/chewlabSB2/denovo_editors
```
** Before we proceed, make sure you have conda working. If you want to install Miniforge in your HPC with the latest architecture, go to https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge and install Miniforge-pypy3-Linux-x86_64 (Linux OS, x86_64 (amd64) architecture). To run install the package:
```bash
bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh  
```
After you have installed Miniforge, re-initialize the terminal or open a new session. 

2. CUDA compiler

Make sure your Cuda compiler driver is 11.1 or later. If you don't have a GPU or don't plan to use a GPU, you can skip this section. if you are running this on HPC with a pre-loaded toolkit, you have to load the module. You can also use CUDA 11.8 or CUDA 12.1.1. 
```bash
module load cuda/12.1.1
nvcc --version
#nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
#Copyright (c) 2005-2023 NVIDIA Corporation
#Built on Mon_Apr__3_17:16:06_PDT_2023
#Cuda compilation tools, release 12.1, V12.1.105
#Build cuda_12.1.r12.1/compiler.32688072_0
```
If you want to view the full list of modules available in your HPC, as well as which modules you have currently loaded:
```bash

```
3. Installation instructions for RFdiffusion
```bash
cd denovo_editors
git clone https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion.git
cd RFdiffusion
mkdir models && cd models
#install all required model weights
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4/Base_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/e29311f6f1bf1af907f9ef9f44b8328b/Complex_base_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/60f09a193fb5e5ccdc4980417708dbab/Complex_Fold_base_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/74f51cfb8b440f50d70878e05361d8f0/InpaintSeq_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/76d00716416567174cdb7ca96e208296/InpaintSeq_Fold_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/5532d2e1f3a4738decd58b19d633b3c3/ActiveSite_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/12fc204edeae5b57713c5ad7dcb97d39/Base_epoch8_ckpt.pt
wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RFdiffusion/1befcb9b28e2f778f53d47f18b7597fa/RF_structure_prediction_weights.pt
```
We also need to set up the conda environment for RFdiffusion, which uses NVIDIA SE(3)-Transformers:
```bash
#within the RFdiffusion subdirectory:
cd ..
conda env create -f env/SE3nv.yml

conda activate SE3nv
cd env/SE3Transformer
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
cd ../.. # change into the root directory of the repository
pip install -e . # install the rfdiffusion module from the root of the repository
```
Anytime you run diffusion you should be sure to activate this conda environment by running the following command:
```bash
conda activate SE3nv #conda deactivate to deactivate the environment
```
Navigate back to the denovo editors directory to continue setting up.
```bash
cd ..
```

4. Installation instructions for MPNN
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN
cd ProteinMPNN
```
We also need to create a conda environment to run MPNN with Pytorch. The latest PyTorch requires Python 3.8 or later so we also need to load the correct python version in our HPC. Here, we avoid using miniforge because it runs python 3.10 as default env, which is not compatible with Pytorch CUDA platform. Instead, we use mamba to create an environment with python3.9 and Pytorch with CUDA 12.1.1
```bash
module load cuda/12.1.1
mamba create -n my_mlfold python=3.9
mamba activate my_mlfold
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio #confirm it worked
```
Navigate back to the denovo editors directory to continue setting up.
```bash
cd ..
```
5.  Installation Instructions for Local AlphaFold

```bash
module load cuda/12.1.1
module load cudnn/8.9.2_cu12
bash install_colabbatch_linux.sh #need to re-upload the bash script to github, ignore initial forzen resolve
mv localcolabfold local_alphafold
export PATH="/path/to/your/local_alphafold/colabfold-conda/bin:$PATH" #It is recommended to add this export command to ~/.bashrc and restart bash (~/.bashrc will be executed every time bash is started)
```
Now you have all the necessary repositories and scripts to run this workflow. 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Instructions for running the workflow*
Navigate to helper_scripts/template_scripts/ to copy the templates for each step.
1. RFdiffusion
```bash
cd helper_scripts/template_scripts/
cp RFdiffusion_bash.sh /home/users/astar/gis/"your_username"/scratch/denovo_editors/RFdiffusion_run1.sh #example
nano RFdiffusion_run1.sh #Change runtime for job based on timesteps and number of designs to generate 
```
Edit and save the bash script according to your requirements in your scratch directory. To submit the job:
```bash
sbatch Rfdiffsuion_run1.sh
```

You can monitor your job using the following commands:
```bash
squeue #view the entire queue
squeue -u your_username #replace 'your_username', you will be able to view the status of all jobs you have submitted
```
